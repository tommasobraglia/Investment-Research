Investment-Research
How does this work? I'll make an update on my personal portfolio exposure everytime i begin/increase/decrease a position.

How often? The goal is to do as little changes as possible over time to avoid paying taxes but let's say once a month should be fine

Other metrics are still to be defined, i'll update as soon as possible!
